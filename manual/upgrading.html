<h1>Upgrading</h1>
<p>Habari's upgrade process is designed to be transparent, with the only indication that an upgrade is happening being a slightly longer page load time the first time the site is visited after the software is updated.</p>

<h2>Before You Upgrade</h2>
<p>Before making any major change in your Habari installation, it would be prudent to create a backup of your database and your installation, in particular all the files in your Habari /user directory. The /user directory should contain all files which you have customized - plugins you have installed, themes you have installed, class files you may have modified, or locale files you have installed.
</p>
<h2>The Upgrade Process</h2>

<ol><li> Download the new version of Habari that you will be installing. Unzip it into the location of your choice.
</li><li> Deactivate your active plugins. Some of the system plugins may have been changed. Some of the plugins you got in other places may not be compatible with the new version of Habari.
</li><li> Delete the following directories
<ol><li> /3rdparty
</li><li> /scripts
</li><li> /doc
</li><li> /system
</li></ol>
</li><li> Delete the index.php, LICENSE, and NOTICE files from the root of your installation. Do <b>not</b> delete your config.php file if it is in the root of your Habari installation, or the .htaccess file.

</li><li> Copy the new version of Habari to the same location as the old version.
</li><li> Using your web browser, navigate to your site. If there are any database changes that need to be made, they will be made automatically at this time.
</li><li> Log into your Habari administrative area. Navigate to the plugins page and reactivate the plugins one by one. 
</li><li> Celebrate and enjoy the new features of your latest version of Habari!
</li></ol>

<h2>Upgrading from Version 0.8.x to Version 0.9</h2>

<p>There are several changes that you should take into account when upgrading. </p>

<h4>Support for PHP 5.2 Removed</h4>
Before upgrading to Habari 0.9 you should ensure that you have at least PHP 5.3.3 installed. <strong>Do not upgrade Habari if you are unable to confirm your host is running at least PHP 5.3.3.</strong>

<h4>Dashboard Module Functionality Re-Implemented</h4>
In Habari 0.9, we've re-used the code that Habari uses for blocks and areas in the theme to implement the dashboard.  There are two consequences to this.  

First, when loading the Habari dashboard for the first time, the dashboard will no longer have the original modules that were present.  Modules will need to be re-added to the dashboard manually.

Second, implementing dashboard modules is now done differently.  If you have installed plugins in Habari 0.8 that provide custom dashboard blocks, these will need to be upgraded to use the new 0.9 functionality before their modules appear for use in the dashboard.
